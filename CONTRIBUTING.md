# Contributions Are Welcome

## How To Contribute

We use the fork & pull workflow. Create a fork of the repository. 
Do the changes in your fork, then submit a pull request. 
If your changes are good, we'll accept them into the main code.

## Acceptance

The likelyhood of a change being accepted depends on what it is, of course. Things that are likely to be accepted are

- bug fixes
- style fixes
- trivial enhancements

Things that will be reviewed and considered

- anything on the roadmap

Things that will not be accepted

- large changes or new features that are not on the roadmap. An example might be making the gacha bot also craft bullets. 


## Style Guide

https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

We use PEP-8 coding style with the following exception. camelCase with lowercase first character is to be used function and variable names, not snake_case.

Make sure your submissions comply.
